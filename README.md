## 👋 **Hello! I'm Paulo Rosado**

Since 2019, I’ve been on a mission to use technology to **free people from tasks that steal their time**.
I’m a **full-stack developer** specialized in **Python**, and I believe that every line of code can open doors for someone to live better.



## 🚀 **My vision**

Most people think technology is just a tool.
I see it as **a shortcut to expansion**.

Throughout my journey, I’ve helped individuals and businesses:

* automate time-consuming tasks
* build a digital presence and gain their voice online
* streamline processes so they can enjoy more free time
* boost productivity without increasing effort

I don’t sell code.
**I give people back their time.**
And time is the most valuable asset we have.



## 🧠 **What drives me**

I truly believe everyone has the potential to live in high performance, and my role as a developer is to **remove the technological barriers** that stand in the way.

I’m driven by:

* solving complex problems with simplicity
* creating systems that work while you live your life
* building solutions that generate real impact
* constant evolution, because the world never stops



## 🎞️ **Beyond the code**

I’m naturally curious.
I love exploring films, series, cultures, history, anything that expands my mind.

And I have a special passion for **old technology**.
Understanding how things were built in the past fuels the way I build for the future.
